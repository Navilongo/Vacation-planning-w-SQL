# sqlalchemy-challenge

We have finally got time for a vacation... in theory at least. For this assignment I have utilized a climate analysis
from Hawaii to showcase some of the sqlalchemy skills I have developed in the past weeks. 

The idea behind this project is: 
Now that I am about to take a trip, I use my SQL skills to assist in the planning of my trip by finding the temperature
of Hawaii at different times of the year; basically, I need to go at the best time. 

To accomplish this I have used data compiled in a file named hawaii.sqlite, which allowed me to explore the tables with 
necessary information for my trip. 

I used SQLAlchemy to reflect my tables into classes and pull important information regarding the rains and the temperature in the past 12 months. 

Included you will find a bar graph of the amount of rain and a historagram of the temperature. 

For convenience sake, we also included information like the minimum precipitation, maximum and average amount of precipitation. 

Lastly, there was an attempt at complete a Flask API which can be accessed from the app in the repository; however,
it may be missing key routes as of the submission of the assignment. 

NOTE: This Flask API is still a work in progress.
